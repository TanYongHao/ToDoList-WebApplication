# To-Do List

Hello! This is a to-do list desktop app created by me, Yong Hao, using HTML, CSS, JS, Node JS and Electron.

# Setup

Install the .exe file in the "Releases" page and run it to install the application. 
Upon installation, three shortcuts will appear on your desktop, two application shortcuts (you can delete one) as well as a .txt shortcut.

The .txt file is where your tasks will be listed, and in there should be three already-existing tasks, which you can replace and add with your own. 
You have to put each task in it's own line.
